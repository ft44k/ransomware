# Conti ransomware

led by Russia-based threat actors, appeared in February 2020 and soon became one of the most active groups in the ransomware space. They use a Ransomware-as-a-Service attack model and pay affiliates for successful deployment. 
Conti’s structure was exposed in August 2021 when a former companion leaked training documents.

Additionally, there are indications that the same group operates the Ryuk ransomware, but definitive proof is yet to be observed. 


The Russia-Ukraine war has contributed to the takedown of the Conti ransomware group since, in February 2022, Conti fully supported Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Such a high-profile announcement to the group about support for Russia and threatening to act on its behalf made it nearly impossible for victim companies to negotiate with them. As a result, almost no payments were made to the group in the months following. 

Conti’s alignment with Russia made financial support to the group illegal and extremely risky. 

## Post-Conti Groups
according to the researchers, Conti has several subsidiaries, such as 
- [Royal](https://github.com/ft44k/ransomware/blob/main/royal.md)
