# Royal

The Royal ransomware group has targeted over 1,000 organizations with a social engineering attack, tricking victims into trusting the attackers. The scheme involves pressuring victims to open a file that is actually a malware loader. If successful, victims can fall victim to ransomware. 

The group may have even created a fake version of the Midnight Group to further deceive victims. This variation of a gambit known as BazarCall involves scaring victims into thinking their systems have been locked by ransomware and manipulating them into installing the actual ransomware. 

Royal is a ransomware group splintered from Conti after backing the Kremlinâ€™s war on Ukraine. The group targets healthcare companies and top-tier corporations for ransom demands ranging from $250,000 to over $2 million. They use BazarCall strategies and have recently targeted Linux systems. Their encryption scheme is implemented correctly, making recent backups or a decryptor the only way to recover lost files.
