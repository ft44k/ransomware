# Black Basta a.k.a. Basta

Black Basta is a group formerly called Conti Team Three. 

They typically use QBot to gain initial access and then deploy the main payload known as Black Basta ransomware.

Black Basta is not a “hit-and-run” gang; aside from ciphering, they commonly steal a certain amount of data. On average, this gang grabs around 500GB of data from each of its victims. Then, following double extortion methods, they ask for an additional ransom to delete the leaked information

Black Basta has a more targeted approach to selecting its victims rather than relying on spray-and-pray tactics. However, the speed with which the malware authors have increased their arsenal of attacks and developed a new Linux build merits further investigation by the ransomware gang behind it.
